title: $:/plugins/yourName/pluginName/readme

This readme will be imported with your plugin. So it should contain the absolute minimum information, that users need to be able to work with your plugin. 

For detailed information you should create an edition, that has A LOT of examples how to use your plugin!

To create an edition you can use the "editon-template" 

```
tiddlywiki editions/myNewEdition --init edition-template
```
